# SPARQL micro-services deployed at https://sparql-micro-services.org

This repository provides the code of the SPARQL micro-services (configuration and SPARQL files) deployed at https://sparql-micro-services.org.
These services meet two needs:
- be a demonstrator for the SPARQL micro-service architecture
- serve some SPARQL micro-services developped and used by several research projects, notably [D2KAB](https://d2kab.org).

The core project (code, documentation, architecture) is in a separate repository: https://github.com/frmichel/sparql-micro-service.
